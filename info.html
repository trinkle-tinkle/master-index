  <h2>info</h2>
  <p>"Master index" refers to an index that joins multiple indexes from different Real Books and similar books. The purpose of a master index is to be able to quickly search and find where a tune is located in the different books instead of manually going through the books. It's also useful to find different transcriptions of the same tune: searching for "all the things you are" will return multiple entries of different transcriptions in different books.</p>

  <h3>books in the database</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Real Book Volume 1</li>
    <li>Real Book Volume 2</li>
    <li>Real Book Volume 3</li>
    <li>New Real Book Volume 1</li>
    <li>New Real Book Volume 2</li>
    <li>New Real Book Volume 3</li>
    <li>Jazz Fake Book</li>
    <li>Jazz LTD</li>
    <li>The Colorado Cookbook</li>
    <li>Library of Musician's Jazz</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>some notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The search engine is very primitive and slow. I'll work on that someday.</li>
    <li>Right now the database (that I extracted from a random PDF on the internet) is quite messy. There are many mistakes to be fixed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>database</h3>
  <p>To add new tunes add a new entry in the end of the data.json file. Use the same naming conventions for the books.</p>
  <p>Books to be added to the database:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real Book Volume 4</li>
    <li>Real Book 5th Edition</li>
    <li>Real Book 6th Edition</li>
    <li>Thelonious Monk Fake Book</li>
    <li>Mingus, more than a fake book</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>code</h3>
  <p>I'm not a programmer and the code is garbage. Everything runs client side so as the database grows it may become too slow at some point. It's fine for now I guess.</p>
